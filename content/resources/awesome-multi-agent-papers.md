description: Curated research papers on multi-agent systems, essential for understanding theoretical foundations.
---

Maintained by Kye Gomez, this repository collects research papers on multi-agent systems. It serves as a bridge between academic research and practical implementation, helping developers understand the theoretical foundations of the tools they use.

Essential reading for those who want to go beyond tutorials and understand why certain agent architectures work better than others. The collection covers topics from Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to emergent behavior in agent swarms.
