description: Entrepreneurial community focused on AI employees, SaaS products, and one-person AI-powered businesses.

IndieHackers focuses on the business of agents. Entrepreneurs here discuss "AI Employees" and SaaS products built by agents or selling agent capabilities.

The discourse is less about "how to code the agent" and more about "how to sell the output of the agent" or "how to use agents to run a one-person business." Threads often explore the market fit for "AI agent teams" that simulate real meetings to solve business problems.

Essential reading for those interested in the commercial applications of agentic systems.
