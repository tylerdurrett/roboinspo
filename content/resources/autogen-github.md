description: Microsoft's framework for building multi-agent conversational AI systems.
featured: true
---

AutoGen is Microsoft's open-source framework for creating multi-agent systems where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve tasks. It popularized the concept of "conversable agents" - the idea that complex problems can be solved by having AI agents talk to each other.

The repository's discussion section is often academic and enterprise-focused, dealing with integration of Azure services and large-scale multi-agent orchestration. It's particularly strong for code generation and multi-step reasoning workflows using the "Coder and Reviewer" pattern.
