description: Counter-narrative community where senior engineers discuss AI agent maintainability concerns.
---

r/ExperiencedDevs provides a necessary counter-narrative to the enthusiasm found in other AI communities. Here, senior engineers discuss the long-term impact of agents on code maintainability.

The prevailing sentiment is often caution - users warn that "vibe coding" can produce "spaghetti code" that is impossible to debug. They discuss the "senior developer" role evolving into a "code reviewer" for AI agents, and the potential for a skills gap in junior developers who rely too heavily on these tools.

Essential reading for anyone wanting a balanced perspective on agent-assisted development.
