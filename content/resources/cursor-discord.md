description: World's first vibe coding community, focused on Cursor IDE and natural language programming.
---

The YouWare Discord describes itself as the "world's first vibe coding community." It is a gathering place for users of the Cursor IDE who focus on natural language programming.

The discourse here is less about Python syntax and more about "prompt engineering" strategies for Cursor's "Composer" mode. Users share tips on how to maintain context windows and prevent the AI from "hallucinating" non-existent APIs.

This is a great community for those embracing the "vibe coding" philosophy and wanting to maximize their productivity with AI-assisted development.
