description: AI hackathon community for finding teammates and building agentic prototypes over weekends.
---

LabLab AI focuses on AI hackathons, making it an excellent venue for finding teammates to build agentic prototypes over a weekend. The hackathon format drives massive amounts of practical, if experimental, agent code generation.

The community often pushes the boundaries of what current tools can do, with participants building novel agent applications under time pressure. Great for networking and rapid skill development through hands-on projects.
