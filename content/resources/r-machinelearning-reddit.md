r/MachineLearning is the venue for high-level academic discourse. While less focused on day-to-day coding assistants, it is the place to track new papers on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that will eventually trickle down to consumer tools.

It is also a space where reputations of framework authors are vetted - the community has hosted threads investigating allegations of plagiarism or over-hyping by creators of certain agent frameworks, serving as a community watchdog.

Essential for those who want to understand the research foundations of agentic systems.
