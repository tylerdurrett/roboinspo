description: Vibrant community for role-playing agents, accessible to beginners building their first crews.
---

The CrewAI Discord is vibrant with beginners and intermediate developers building their first "crews." Discussion often centers on defining "tasks" and "agents" in YAML or Python configurations.

It is a key location for finding "templates" of agent teams (e.g., "Marketing Crew," "Coding Crew"). The accessible nature of CrewAI makes this community particularly welcoming to those new to multi-agent systems.

The community regularly shares configurations and troubleshoots common patterns, making it an excellent learning environment.
