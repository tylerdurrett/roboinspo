description: Support and discussion community for the LangChain ecosystem and LangGraph agents.
---

r/LangChain acts as the overflow room for the massive LangChain ecosystem. As the framework has evolved from simple "chains" to the more complex, agentic "LangGraph," the subreddit has become filled with debugging questions regarding stateful multi-agent graphs.

Users frequently ask about migrating legacy codebases to new agentic paradigms and discuss the intricacies of "human-in-the-loop" systems, where an agent must pause and wait for user approval before executing code.

The subreddit serves as a good complement to the official Discord, with longer-form discussions and archived solutions that remain searchable over time.
