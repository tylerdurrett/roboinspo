description: Experimental high-velocity community pursuing hierarchical swarm research and rapid implementation.
---

This community is dedicated to the swarms Python framework and is known for its aggressive, high-velocity culture. Led by Kye Gomez, the community pursues "agora" style research, focusing on hierarchical swarm structures where a "Director" agent oversees specialized "Worker" agents.

The discourse is experimental and sometimes controversial, with rapid implementation of the latest research papers. Not for the faint of heart, but essential for those on the cutting edge of multi-agent systems.
