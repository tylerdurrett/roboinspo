description: Ground zero for Claude Code discussions, system prompts, and Computer Use beta features.
featured: true
---

With Claude being the current state-of-the-art model for coding, the Anthropic Discord is Ground Zero for discussions on "Claude Code." Developers share "system prompts" - the hidden instructions that tell Claude how to behave - to unlock higher performance in coding tasks.

There is strong focus on the "Computer Use" beta, where Claude can control a mouse and keyboard, interacting with GUIs directly. Direct interaction with Anthropic staff makes this invaluable for understanding Claude's capabilities and limitations.
