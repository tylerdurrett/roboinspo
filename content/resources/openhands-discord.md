description: Open-source autonomous engineer community focusing on sandbox environments and SWE-bench evaluation.
---

OpenHands (formerly OpenDevin) Discord is a hub for contributors actively building this open-source autonomous software engineer. Channels focus on "sandbox" environments - the Docker containers required to safely let an agent execute code without destroying the host machine - and "evaluation," where users benchmark the agent's performance on standard coding datasets like SWE-bench.

The vibe is highly collaborative with an open-source ethos. This is where you go to contribute to the project or understand the cutting edge of autonomous code generation.
