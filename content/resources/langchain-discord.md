description: Official LangChain/LangGraph Discord with direct access to maintainers and active support.
featured: true
---

With the shift toward "controllable" agents, LangGraph has become an industry standard, and the Discord server is the primary support channel for this complex library. Activity levels are extremely high as the move from "chains" to "agents" has driven thousands of developers into channels dedicated to state management and graph definition.

Users congregate in channels like #langgraph, #multi-agent, and #showcase to demo complex coding swarms. Discussions often revolve around the "persistence" of agent memory - how to make an agent "remember" a conversation across different sessions - and the integration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The server provides direct access to LangChain maintainers, making it invaluable for troubleshooting complex issues.
