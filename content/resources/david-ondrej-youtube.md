description: Deep dives into Agent Zero, autonomous frameworks, and memory management with MemGPT.
---

David Ondrej specializes in "Agent Zero" and autonomous frameworks. His content bridges the gap between experimentation and actual software engineering, providing tutorials on building "computer-using agents" and deep dives into memory management.

His coverage of MemGPT explains how to give agents long-term recall, a critical capability for complex agentic workflows. Content like "I just replaced myself with Clawdbot" exemplifies the "replacement" narrative driving high engagement in the autonomous agent niche.
