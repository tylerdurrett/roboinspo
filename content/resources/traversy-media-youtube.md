description: Veteran coding educator bridging traditional web development with AI-assisted workflows.
---

Traversy Media is a veteran in traditional coding education who has pivoted to include Cursor and AI-assisted workflows. This channel serves as a critical bridge for legacy developers - web developers and full-stack engineers - who are trying to adapt to the agentic era without abandoning their foundational skills.

Brad's teaching style emphasizes practical, project-based learning that helps experienced developers integrate AI tools into their existing workflows rather than starting from scratch.
