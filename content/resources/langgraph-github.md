description: State machine-based agent orchestration for controllable, production-ready multi-agent systems.
featured: true
---

LangGraph provides graph-based agent orchestration, treating agents as nodes in a state machine where the developer explicitly defines the transitions between agents. This approach has become the "professional choice" for enterprises requiring predictable agent behavior.

The repository hosts highly active discussions on graph theory applied to agent state. It is where the "cognitive architecture" of agents is debated and defined. The community consensus has shifted toward LangGraph for production use due to its control and predictability compared to more experimental swarm approaches.
