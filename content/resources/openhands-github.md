description: Open-source autonomous software engineer competing with proprietary solutions like Devin.
featured: true
---

OpenHands (formerly OpenDevin) is an open-source project building an autonomous software engineer. The repository is a hub for those interested in sandbox technology - the hard problem of how to let an AI run code on a user's machine without creating security vulnerabilities.

The community tackles evaluation against standard coding datasets like SWE-bench, and discussions focus on the Docker containers required to safely execute agent-generated code. A collaborative, open-source alternative to proprietary autonomous coding tools.
