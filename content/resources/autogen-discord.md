description: Microsoft's AutoGen community focused on conversable multi-agent systems and swarm patterns.
---

AutoGen popularized the concept of "conversable agents" - the idea that the best way to solve a problem is to have two AI agents talk to each other (e.g., a "Coder" and a "Reviewer").

While Microsoft maintains the official AutoGen server, spin-off communities and "Agent Ops" groups often discuss practical implementation of AutoGen swarms in production, sometimes diverging from the official roadmap.

The culture is heavily focused on swarms - groups of agents with distinct roles working together. Troubleshooting often involves debugging "infinite conversation loops" where agents compliment each other endlessly instead of writing code.
