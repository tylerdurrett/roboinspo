description: No-hype AI agent content focused on running agents in actual business workflows.
---

Cole Medin's channel is known for its "no-hype" approach to AI agents. He focuses on "building + running AI agents in actual workflows," avoiding the sensationalism common in the space.

His content is particularly valuable for developers looking for realistic assessments of agent capabilities in business contexts. Rather than promising revolutionary changes overnight, he shows what actually works in production environments today.
