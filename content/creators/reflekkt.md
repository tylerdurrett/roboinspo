Reflekkt is the definitive resource for projection mapping in TouchDesigner. Tutorials cover the entire pipeline: from photogrammetry scanning with RealityCapture, to projector calibration using CamSchnappr, to creating content that maps perfectly to 3D surfaces. Often bridges into Blender workflows for complete project coverage.
