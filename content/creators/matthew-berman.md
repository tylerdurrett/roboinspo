Matthew Berman is the leading technical reviewer for the open-source AI community. His channel provides exhaustive walkthroughs of complex tasks, such as installing local LLMs, setting up AutoGen Studio, and configuring "agent swarms."

His videos are often the first place new tools (like a new OpenHands release or new agent integrations) are showcased to a mass audience. His Discord server acts as a massive general-purpose help desk for the open-source AI community, making him a central figure in the practical agent development space.
