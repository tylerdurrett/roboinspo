Brad Traversy is a veteran in traditional coding education who has pivoted to include Cursor and AI-assisted workflows. His channel, Traversy Media, serves as a critical bridge for legacy developers - web developers and full-stack engineers - who are trying to adapt to the agentic era without abandoning their foundational skills.

His teaching style emphasizes practical, project-based learning that helps experienced developers integrate AI tools into their existing workflows rather than starting from scratch.
