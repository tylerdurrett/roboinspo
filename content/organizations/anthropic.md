Anthropic has positioned Claude as the state-of-the-art model for coding tasks, making it a foundational component of many agentic coding systems. Their developer community Discord has become a hub for discussions on Claude Code, system prompts, and the Computer Use beta.

The company's focus on AI safety has influenced how developers think about agent reliability and controllability. Claude's strong performance on coding benchmarks has made it the model of choice for many agent builders.
