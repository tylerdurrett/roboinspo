description: Framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents with accessible configuration.

CrewAI focuses on "role-playing" agents and process orchestration, marketing itself as more accessible than alternatives like AutoGen. The framework allows developers to define "crews" of agents with distinct roles that work together on complex tasks.

Configuration through YAML or Python makes CrewAI particularly approachable for developers new to multi-agent systems. The community actively shares templates for common agent team patterns like "Marketing Crew" and "Coding Crew."
