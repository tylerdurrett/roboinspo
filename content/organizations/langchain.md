LangChain has become one of the most widely adopted frameworks for building applications powered by large language models. Their flagship product LangGraph provides state machine-based agent orchestration that has become an industry standard for controllable, production-ready multi-agent systems.

The LangChain ecosystem includes extensive documentation, a vibrant Discord community, and tight integrations with major LLM providers. Their shift from simple "chains" to the more complex "LangGraph" has positioned them as the professional choice for enterprises requiring predictable agent behavior.
