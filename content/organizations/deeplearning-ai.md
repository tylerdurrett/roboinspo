DeepLearning.AI, associated with Andrew Ng's courses, provides an academic and structured environment for learning about AI agents. Their community forum hosts specific sub-forums for "Agentic AI," "Multi-Agent Systems with CrewAI," and "Building Coding Agents."

Unlike the more chaotic Reddit and Discord communities, conversations here are structured, moderated, and focused on learning and course completion. An excellent starting point for developers who prefer a curriculum-based approach to learning agent development.
