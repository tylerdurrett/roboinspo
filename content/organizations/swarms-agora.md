The Swarms community, led by Kye Gomez, pursues "agora" style research focusing on hierarchical swarm structures where "Director" agents oversee specialized "Worker" agents. Known for its aggressive, high-velocity culture and rapid implementation of the latest research papers.

The swarms Python framework represents the experimental cutting edge of multi-agent systems, sometimes controversial but always pushing boundaries. The community Discord is highly active with developers implementing new swarm patterns.
