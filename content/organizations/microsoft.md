Microsoft has been a major player in the agentic AI space through their AutoGen framework, which popularized the concept of "conversable agents" - the idea that complex problems can be solved by having multiple AI agents converse with each other.

AutoGen pioneered patterns like the "Coder and Reviewer" dynamic, where one agent writes code while another reviews it. The framework is particularly popular in enterprise settings due to its Azure integrations and Microsoft's backing.
