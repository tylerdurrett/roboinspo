OpenHands (formerly OpenDevin) is an open-source project building an autonomous software engineer to compete with proprietary solutions like Devin. The community is a hub for contributors actively building and benchmarking the tool.

Key technical discussions focus on "sandbox" environments - the Docker containers required to safely let an agent execute code without destroying the host machine - and evaluation against standard coding datasets like SWE-bench. The project embodies a highly collaborative, open-source ethos.
