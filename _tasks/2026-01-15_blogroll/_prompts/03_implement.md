I want to add a markdown-based blogroll "database" to this repo.

We determined the tech stack. See:
`_tasks/2026-01-15_blogroll/01_tech-stack.md`

We decided on the data model. See:
`_tasks/2026-01-15_blogroll/02_data-model.md`

Now, let's build it using this implementation plan:
`_tasks/2026-01-15_blogroll/03_implementation-plan.md`

Now, please read through the code to get a complete and detailed understanding of the system. Then, procede to implement the plan using standard best practices and clean, maintainable, well-documented code following the established codebase patterns.
