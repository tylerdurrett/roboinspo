Here are changes that need to be applied to `.agents/tasks/2025-09-25_video-feed/task-description_UPDATED.md`

- I removed the Lenis provider because I don't want to affect scroll on any pages.
- The feed index should be located at `/things` and individual things will be located at `/thing/[id]`
- I would like this to be reusable between different React projects (including non NextJS sites). Please keep that in mind.
